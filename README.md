# IndexReplica-KalmanFilter
Develop and evaluate systematic strategies to replicate the performance of a black box  index.  By testing multiple machine learning models it was found that the best performing approach was a Kalman Filter initialized with Ridge regression. Subsequently, we applied various strategies to enhance robustness.
